-Supporting Documentation
-
-The following documentation was available to the review team:
-     ● Devp2p: h​ ttps://github.com/ethereum/devp2p
-     ● EIP 778: Ethereum Node Records (ENR): ​https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778
-
-Areas of Concern
-
-Our investigation focused on the following areas:
-
-     ● Considerations for individual nodes participating in the network
-     ● Considerations for the collective network operations as a whole
-     ● Potential attacks, such as:
-
-                ○ Amplification attacks (e.g via spoofing make peers transmit data to a target),
-                ○ Eclipse attacks (manipulate a target to connect only to malicious peers)
-                ○ DoS attacks, such as:
-
-                           ■ With small effort, cause a peer to expend a large effort (cpu/memory etc),
-                           ■ With low bandwidth, cause a peer to utilize large bandwidth
-                ○ Other possible attacks, as identified during the review
-     ● The cryptography used by the protocol:
-                ○ Suitability of the chosen algorithms
-                ○ Correct use of the chosen algorithms
-
-Findings
-
-General Comments
-
-These are overall findings that in most cases should be addressed holistically.
-
-Design and Documentation Approach
-
-We found the specification to be readable, well-explained and easy to understand, however, there were
-terms in the specification that lacked proper definition and technical description. This presented certain
-challenges for us and required some assumptions to be made in our audit, particularly around the Topic
-registration system. It is commendable that many security concerns are already noted, including a
-number of proposed mitigation strategies. This allowed us to identify leads early on in our investigation
-and expand upon some of the known shortcomings.
-
-Identity Key Generation
-
-The primary concern resulting from our review is the lack of a proof scheme for identity key generation,
-especially given that eclipse attacks have been a problem with the Ethereum network in the past. We
-strongly recommend that an identity proof system, like the one proposed in this report, be employed in the
-next iteration of the specification.
-
-Topic Subsystem Complexity
-
-In addition, we found that the specification did not adequately explain use-cases for the topic subsystem
-in order to justify its relative complexity. There were no data or test cases identified to support the need
-for its inclusion and, as a result, we were not able to properly evaluate the topic subsystem. We strongly
-recommend a follow up evaluation after this aspect of the specification is more thoroughly documented.

-AES-GCM in the Wire Protocol
-
-Overall, we found that in the wire protocol AES-GCM is used properly, and in accordance with best
-practices. However, this is based on certain assumptions and we were not able to assess side channel
-attacks due to the lack of code. Our assumption is that the implementation of a​ esgcm_(de/en)crypt
-is in accordance with the specification
-(h​ ttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf​) and that the key
-auth-resp-key is a one time key.
-
-Since there was no mention of the strength of the authentication tag, we were not able to reason about
-that particular component. However, it is worth noting that the use of short tag lengths will limit the
-amount of the input data and the lifetime of each single key.
-
-Our analysis found that 128bit key length is best practice for non quantum-computer attacks and, since
-messages are not longer than 1280byte ~=~2^6*128= bit, weak key attacks as described in
-https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/202.pdf​, whether possible or not, can only lower the security to about 122bits,
-which is acceptable.
-
-We also reviewed the following list of steps with which aes_gcm is used in the wire protocol:
-
-     1. auth-response = a​ esgcm_encrypt(auth-resp-key, zero-nonce, auth-response-pt,
-          "")
-
-     2. message = a​ esgcm_encrypt(initiator-key, auth-tag, message-pt, tag ||
-          auth-header)
-
-     3. message = a​ esgcm_encrypt(initiator-key, auth-tag, message-pt, tag)
-     4. ticket = aesgcm_encrypt(ticket-key, ticket-nonce, ticket-pt, '')
-
-For auth-response, the auth-resp-key&zero-nonce combination can only be used a single time. Since this
-nonce is a protocol constant, we assume auth-resp-key can only be used a single time. A 96bit nonce is
-best practice, although not strictly necessary in this context. Furthermore, auth-response-pt is at the max
-limit of encryption bits: (2^39)−256 bits ([1] 5.2.1.1). We also note that is safe to be executed without any
-authentication data.
-
-For message(s) in auth-tag, the length of the random field is 96 bits fixed for the life of the key and this is
-the RBG-based construction from ([1] 8.2.2), which is recommended. Since RBG mode is used, there are
-constraints on the number of invocations, i.e the total number of invocations shall not exceed 2^32, w.r.t.
-to any fixed initiator-key.
-
-In message-pt, if the wire protocol limits message size to 1280bytes, the amount of encrypted and
-authenticated data is way below the limit of (2^39)−256 bits ([1] 5.2.1.1) and auth-tag is a critical security
-parameter as defined in FIPS Pub. 140-2.
-
-However, we were not able to review ticket because ticket-key and ticket-nonce are not defined. (Please
-see ​Suggestion 1​).

-
-Issue A: Intentional Lack of Proof-of-x Scheme for Identity Generation
-
-Synopsis
-
-The specification directly acknowledges the lack of employment of a proof scheme for node identity
-generation, supporting this choice by citing hardware requirements posing a barrier to entry. This allows
-nodes to freely choose their node fingerprint, making eclipse attacks trivial.
-
-Impact
-
-Critical. An attacker can assert control over parts of the network identity key space, thereby allowing them
-to deny service, return invalid information, and poison the routing tables of other network participants.
-
-Preconditions
-
-Attacker must control a minimum of 16 IP addresses in order to fill one of a target’s buckets entirely with
-nodes they control. Controlling more IP addresses increases the impact.
-
-Feasibility
-
-Trivial. This can be done for free using Amazon EC2 t2.micro instances.
-
-Technical Details
-
-Kademlia-based overlay networks use the XOR of two identity keys as a distance metric. This distance
-determines the index of the K-bucket (a sorted peer list) in which a given peer will be placed. Since there
-are always more identities that are very distant than very close, the Kademlia routing table contains
-mostly peers that are very distant. The goal of an Eclipse attack is to generate identity keys that target a
-specific bucket in order fill a victim’s peer list with nodes that are controlled by the attacker.
-
-In a Kademlia network where nodes may freely select their identity key, this type of attack is trivial. The
-DevP2P specification places the requirement that identities are validated - the key is the hash of the
-public portion of a SECP256k1 pair. This has the side effect of preventing nodes from choosing any
-arbitrary identity key. Since these keys are computationally cheap to generate, we have demonstrated that
-eclipse attacks are still trivial.

-In our proof of concept attack (which is shown in the a​ ccompanying repository​), we took an arbitrary valid
-target key and attempted to fill that target’s K-buckets (16 peers each) with valid identity keys derived in a
-manner consistent with the specification. The code for this attack was intentionally left poorly optimized
-such that it:
-
-     ● Runs on a single CPU core, generating a single identity at a time
-     ● Cracks buckets sequentially, starting at the furthest
-     ● Discards keys found that do not belong in the bucket that is currently being cracked
-
-This poor optimization is intended to demonstrate a sort of “best case scenario” - the attacker not having
-access to capable hardware. Our results showed that over the course of a 7 hour test, we were able to fill
-the target’s furthest 24 buckets completely (384 nodes). Perhaps more importantly, the first 19 of these
-buckets were cracked within the first half hour or the test.
-
-As the plot above shows, the time to crack each bucket takes roughly twice the time to crack the previous
-bucket, which is consistent with how we understand Kademlia’s routing table. Since there are always
-more nodes that are distant than close, eclipsing even the first 18 buckets (as is shown to be completed
-within minutes) is more than sufficient to cause significant disruption to a given target(s). Given the very

-low barrier to this attack, we believe that it could be carried out trivially using free cloud infrastructure
-such as Amazon t2.micro and that attackers with access to even modest hardware could cause critical
-disruption in the network.
-
-Mitigation
-
-The specification acknowledges that a proof scheme is a well-accepted mitigation strategy for eclipse
-attacks, yet dismisses the use of one citing that mobile devices would not be able to participate in the
-network. This may be true for CPU intensive proof-of-work schemes, but is not necessarily the case for
-RAM intensive schemes.
-
-Requiring that identity keys are derived from an asymmetric proof like Equihash could prove to be a
-strong mitigation strategy for these types of attacks. Memory hard proofs make for an excellent trade off.
-Even lower end semi-modern mobile devices often have at least 3GB of RAM and can generate a network
-identity without much burden or time. However, this baseline memory requirement excludes an entire
-class of virtual private server offerings, such as free Amazon t2.micro instances. We ran our same attack,
-this time doing so using our mitigation strategy for comparison.
-
-Given the same test case, but with our mitigation strategy implemented, we were only able to fill the
-furthest 5 buckets within the same 8 hour period. Even this was only achievable due to availability of
-
-Security Audit Report | Ethereum Foundation                                                             7

-~4GB RAM, making this attack much harder to parallelize than the previous test. The critical difference
-here is the difference between the initial time to crack the first bucket. On the first bucket, it took about 1
-minute per identity, because most generated keys are valid for that bucket. We feel this is a reasonable
-barrier for users upon first connecting (or rather first generating an identity key), but poses significant
-burden on would-be attackers.
-
-Of course, this strategy is not perfect and an attacker could generate the identities offline on other
-hardware for use in a similar manner, acknowledging that doing so would prove to be significantly more
-expensive. Furthering this scheme such that nodes are required to continually improve their proof over
-time is a worthwhile research endeavour.
-
-Remediation
-
-Complete remediation of this vulnerability is an area of active research and there are no known strategies
-that completely eliminate the possibility of a determined and capable attacker carrying out this type of
-attack.
-
-Status
-
-The specification acknowledges that proof schemes for identity generation are well researched, yet still
-opposes their use due to what the authors consider to be resource constraints. A ticket has been opened
-for public comment on how to proceed.
-
-Verification
-
-Unresolved: I​ n Discussion.​
-
-Issue B: Lookup Operation Does Not Include Disjoint Paths
-
-Synopsis
-
-The specification does not specify the use of disjoint lookup paths, which can make various identity and
-malicious routing attacks far more effective
-
-Impact
-
-High. If an attacker manages to control multiple nodes in a lookup path, they can manipulate the
-information delivered back to the lookup originator.
-
-Preconditions
-
-Attacker must control multiple nodes along a particular lookup path.
-
-Feasibility
-
-Trivial. This can be done very inexpensively using Amazon EC2 t3.nano instances or a similar offering
-from any virtual private server provider.
-
-Technical Details
-
-The specification outlines a solution where Kademlia table buckets are limited to two nodes from every
-/24 IP subnetwork and limits the entire table to 10 nodes per /24 IP subnetwork. This is susceptible to IP
-spoofing and anonymizing protocols where IP addresses aren’t scarce or reliably related to a single node.
-The handshake would not prevent this because according to the provided specification, the handshake
-does not verify the IP address of the requesting node or the recipient node.
-
-The specification does not provide an exact lookup algorithm for nodes. Instead, they simply define their
-lookup as an “iterative lookup”, which is consistent with Kademlia. However, particularly in the case of a
-

-moderate number of adversarial nodes, the lookup algorithm benefits significantly from implementing a
-lookup that utilizes multiple disjoint paths to find nodes in the network.
-
-Mitigation
-
-Instead of limiting by IP address and subnets, we can rely on the mitigation previously outlined in Issue A
-in combination with an improved lookup algorithm that utilizes multiple disjoint lookup paths. In the
-original Kademlia specification, lookup requests iteratively query nodes, however the lookup fails if an
-adversarial node is encountered.
-
-To improve the lookup algorithm, we can implement multiple disjoint lookup paths. First, we break up the
-`k` closest nodes into `d` independent buckets, and then we kick off `d` parallel ​FIND_NODE​requests as
-usual, with one difference: we ensure we only query each node once during all of these lookups. This
-ensures that the lookup paths are truly disjoint and that encountering an adversarial node does not result
-in a failure or in the adversarial node becoming a contact and possibly becoming a bucket entry of ours.
-
-Remediation
-
-Implement multiple disjoint lookup paths.
-
-Status
-
-The specification has been updated to include details around session state storage, which resolves the
-issue where IP addresses are not verified in the handshake. In addition, the specification includes that
-multiple disjoint paths should be used during lookups.

-
-Issue C: Handshake Authentication is Broken
-
-Location
-
-https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-wire.md#handshake
-
-Synopsis
-
-The handshake protocol allows an active attacker to undermine authentication.
-
-Impact
-
-High. Allows active attackers to impersonate other nodes.
-
-Technical Details
-
-The specification states
-
-auth-response-pt = [version, id-nonce-sig, node-record]
-
-version                        =5
-
-id-nonce-sig                   = sign(static-node-key, sha256("discovery-id-nonce" ||
-
-id-nonce))
-
-...
-
-The ​id-nonce-sig​proves liveness to the receiver of the packet, but since it does not sign the
-ephemeral key of the initiator, an active attacker can simply replace the ephemeral key with one that they
-know the secret to. Then, the responder will accept, and use a key that is known to the attacker (but not
-the initiator).

-Remediation
-
-This class of protocols is very difficult to design and implement correctly. As a result, there have been
-numerous attacks on TLS 1.2 in the last ten to twenty years.
-
-We recommend learning from history by using a well-understood key exchange protocol such as DTLS,
-preferably DTLS 1.3, even in its current draft version.
-
-Mitigation
-
-Another option is to include the ephemeral key in the computation of the signature:
-
-            id-nonce-sig = sign(static-node-key,
-                                                sha256("discovery-id-nonce" || id-nonce || init-eph))
-
-This way, the responder will notice that the adversary replaced the ephemeral key and the attack is
-prevented.

-Suggestions
-
-Suggestion 1: Better Documentation of Terms and Definitions
-
-Location
-
-https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p
-
-Synopsis
-
-There were several places in the protocol where terms were simply never defined or were insufficiently
-detailed in their definition. This required us to make some assumptions around the basic workings of
-some parts of the system.
-
-For example, the Topic Registration system lacked any meaningful documentation which forced us to
-make some assumptions around its purpose and mechanics in the protocol.
-
-Mitigation
-
-More thorough documentation and definition of terms in the protocol.

-Synopsis
-
-The ​tag​part of handshake messages can be used to confirm that the node protocol is used. Consider
-three nodes A, B and C. If all three nodes communicate with each other, the xor of their tags will result in
-0:
-
-tag-A-to-B                                   = xor(sha256(B-node-id), A-node-id)
-tag-A-to-C                                   = xor(sha256(C-node-id), A-node-id)
-tag-B-to-A                                   = xor(sha256(A-node-id), B-node-id)
-tag-B-to-C                                   = xor(sha256(C-node-id), B-node-id)
-tag-C-to-A                                   = xor(sha256(A-node-id), C-node-id)
-tag-C-to-B                                   = xor(sha256(B-node-id), C-node-id)
-
-xor1 = xor(tag-B-to-A, tag-C-to-A) = xor(B-node-id, C-node-id)
-xor2 = xor(tag-A-to-B, tag-C-to-B) = xor(A-node-id, C-node-id)
-xor3 = xor(tag-A-to-C, tag-B-to-C) = xor(A-node-id, B-node-id)
-
-xor12 = xor(xor1, xor2) = xor(A-node-id, B-node-id) = xor3
-xor(xor12, xor3) = 0
-
-Since the attack is technically just out of scope, it is only added as a suggestion. Mostly, it shows that key
-exchange protocols are complex and it is very easy to miss subtle issues.
-
-Mitigation

-Use a well-understood key exchange protocol.

-
-Location

-https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-wire.md#handshake
-
-Synopsis
-
-Since RBG mode is used, there are constraints on the number of invocations, i.e the total number of
-invocations shall not exceed 2^32, w.r.t. to any fixed initiator-key. Also, auth-tag is a critical security
-parameter as defined in FIPS Pub. 140-2 and the RGB generator must properly handle edge cases like loss
-of power, etc.
-
-Mitigation
-
-The auth-tag must be the output of an approved RBG, which must be independently initiated on any
-device.

-
-Our Methodology
-
-We like to work with a transparent process and make our reviews a collaborative effort. The goals of our
-security audits are to improve the quality of systems we review and aim for sufficient remediation to help
-protect users. The following is the methodology we use in our security audit process.
-
-Manual Review
-
-In manually reviewing all of the documentation and code, we look for any potential issues with design and
-code logic, including error handling, protocol and header parsing, cryptographic errors, and random
-number generators. We also watch for areas where more defensive programming could reduce the risk of
-future mistakes and speed up future audits. Although our primary focus is on the in-scope documentation
-and code, we examine dependency code and behavior when it is relevant to a particular line of
-investigation.
-
-Vulnerability Analysis
-
-Our audit techniques included manual code analysis, user interface interaction, and whitebox penetration
-testing. We look at the project's web site to get a high level understanding of what functionality the
-software under review provides. We then meet with the developers to gain an appreciation of their vision
-of the software. We install and use the relevant software, exploring the user interactions and roles. While
-we do this, we brainstorm threat models and attack surfaces. We read design documentation, review
-other audit results, search for similar projects, examine source code dependencies, skim open issue
-tickets, and generally investigate details other than the implementation. We hypothesize what
-vulnerabilities may be present, creating Issue entries, and for each we follow the following Issue
-Investigation and Remediation process.

-Documenting Results
-
-We follow a conservative, transparent process for analyzing potential security vulnerabilities and seeing
-them through successful remediation. Whenever a potential issue is discovered, we immediately create
-an Issue entry for it in this document, even though we have not yet verified the feasibility and impact of
-the issue. This process is conservative because we document our suspicions early even if they are later
-shown to not represent exploitable vulnerabilities. We generally follow a process of first documenting the
-suspicion with unresolved questions, then confirming the issue through code analysis, live
-experimentation, or automated tests. Code analysis is the most tentative, and we strive to provide test
-code, log captures, or screenshots demonstrating our confirmation. After this we analyze the feasibility of
-an attack in a live system.
-
-Suggested Solutions
-
-We search for immediate mitigations that live deployments can take, and finally we suggest the
-requirements for remediation engineering for future releases. The mitigation and remediation
-recommendations should be scrutinized by the developers and deployment engineers, and successful
-mitigation and remediation is an ongoing collaborative process after we deliver our report, and before the
-details are made public.
-
-Responsible Disclosure
-
-Before our report or any details about our findings and suggested solutions are made public, we like to
-work with your team to find reasonable outcomes that can be addressed as soon as possible without an
-overly negative impact on pre-existing plans. Although the handling of issues must be done on a
-case-by-case basis, we always like to agree on a timeline for resolution that balances the impact on the
-users and the needs of your project team. We take this agreed timeline into account before publishing any
-reports to avoid the necessity for full disclosure.

+Supporting Documentation
+
+The following documentation was available to the review team:
+     ● Devp2p: h​ ttps://github.com/ethereum/devp2p
+     ● EIP 778: Ethereum Node Records (ENR): ​https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778
+
+Areas of Concern
+
+Our investigation focused on the following areas:
+
+     ● Considerations for individual nodes participating in the network
+     ● Considerations for the collective network operations as a whole
+     ● Potential attacks, such as:
+
+                ○ Amplification attacks (e.g via spoofing make peers transmit data to a target),
+                ○ Eclipse attacks (manipulate a target to connect only to malicious peers)
+                ○ DoS attacks, such as:
+
+                           ■ With small effort, cause a peer to expend a large effort (cpu/memory etc),
+                           ■ With low bandwidth, cause a peer to utilize large bandwidth
+                ○ Other possible attacks, as identified during the review
+     ● The cryptography used by the protocol:
+                ○ Suitability of the chosen algorithms
+                ○ Correct use of the chosen algorithms
+
+Findings
+
+General Comments
+
+These are overall findings that in most cases should be addressed holistically.
+
+Design and Documentation Approach
+
+We found the specification to be readable, well-explained and easy to understand, however, there were
+terms in the specification that lacked proper definition and technical description. This presented certain
+challenges for us and required some assumptions to be made in our audit, particularly around the Topic
+registration system. It is commendable that many security concerns are already noted, including a
+number of proposed mitigation strategies. This allowed us to identify leads early on in our investigation
+and expand upon some of the known shortcomings.
+
+Identity Key Generation
+
+The primary concern resulting from our review is the lack of a proof scheme for identity key generation,
+especially given that eclipse attacks have been a problem with the Ethereum network in the past. We
+strongly recommend that an identity proof system, like the one proposed in this report, be employed in the
+next iteration of the specification.
+
+Topic Subsystem Complexity
+
+In addition, we found that the specification did not adequately explain use-cases for the topic subsystem
+in order to justify its relative complexity. There were no data or test cases identified to support the need
+for its inclusion and, as a result, we were not able to properly evaluate the topic subsystem. We strongly
+recommend a follow up evaluation after this aspect of the specification is more thoroughly documented.

+AES-GCM in the Wire Protocol
+
+Overall, we found that in the wire protocol AES-GCM is used properly, and in accordance with best
+practices. However, this is based on certain assumptions and we were not able to assess side channel
+attacks due to the lack of code. Our assumption is that the implementation of a​ esgcm_(de/en)crypt
+is in accordance with the specification
+(h​ ttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf​) and that the key
+auth-resp-key is a one time key.
+
+Since there was no mention of the strength of the authentication tag, we were not able to reason about
+that particular component. However, it is worth noting that the use of short tag lengths will limit the
+amount of the input data and the lifetime of each single key.
+
+Our analysis found that 128bit key length is best practice for non quantum-computer attacks and, since
+messages are not longer than 1280byte ~=~2^6*128= bit, weak key attacks as described in
+https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/202.pdf​, whether possible or not, can only lower the security to about 122bits,
+which is acceptable.
+
+We also reviewed the following list of steps with which aes_gcm is used in the wire protocol:
+
+     1. auth-response = a​ esgcm_encrypt(auth-resp-key, zero-nonce, auth-response-pt,
+          "")
+
+     2. message = a​ esgcm_encrypt(initiator-key, auth-tag, message-pt, tag ||
+          auth-header)
+
+     3. message = a​ esgcm_encrypt(initiator-key, auth-tag, message-pt, tag)
+     4. ticket = aesgcm_encrypt(ticket-key, ticket-nonce, ticket-pt, '')
+
+For auth-response, the auth-resp-key&zero-nonce combination can only be used a single time. Since this
+nonce is a protocol constant, we assume auth-resp-key can only be used a single time. A 96bit nonce is
+best practice, although not strictly necessary in this context. Furthermore, auth-response-pt is at the max
+limit of encryption bits: (2^39)−256 bits ([1] 5.2.1.1). We also note that is safe to be executed without any
+authentication data.
+
+For message(s) in auth-tag, the length of the random field is 96 bits fixed for the life of the key and this is
+the RBG-based construction from ([1] 8.2.2), which is recommended. Since RBG mode is used, there are
+constraints on the number of invocations, i.e the total number of invocations shall not exceed 2^32, w.r.t.
+to any fixed initiator-key.
+
+In message-pt, if the wire protocol limits message size to 1280bytes, the amount of encrypted and
+authenticated data is way below the limit of (2^39)−256 bits ([1] 5.2.1.1) and auth-tag is a critical security
+parameter as defined in FIPS Pub. 140-2.
+
+However, we were not able to review ticket because ticket-key and ticket-nonce are not defined. (Please
+see ​Suggestion 1​).

+
+Issue A: Intentional Lack of Proof-of-x Scheme for Identity Generation
+
+Synopsis
+
+The specification directly acknowledges the lack of employment of a proof scheme for node identity
+generation, supporting this choice by citing hardware requirements posing a barrier to entry. This allows
+nodes to freely choose their node fingerprint, making eclipse attacks trivial.
+
+Impact
+
+Critical. An attacker can assert control over parts of the network identity key space, thereby allowing them
+to deny service, return invalid information, and poison the routing tables of other network participants.
+
+Preconditions
+
+Attacker must control a minimum of 16 IP addresses in order to fill one of a target’s buckets entirely with
+nodes they control. Controlling more IP addresses increases the impact.
+
+Feasibility
+
+Trivial. This can be done for free using Amazon EC2 t2.micro instances.
+
+Technical Details
+
+Kademlia-based overlay networks use the XOR of two identity keys as a distance metric. This distance
+determines the index of the K-bucket (a sorted peer list) in which a given peer will be placed. Since there
+are always more identities that are very distant than very close, the Kademlia routing table contains
+mostly peers that are very distant. The goal of an Eclipse attack is to generate identity keys that target a
+specific bucket in order fill a victim’s peer list with nodes that are controlled by the attacker.
+
+In a Kademlia network where nodes may freely select their identity key, this type of attack is trivial. The
+DevP2P specification places the requirement that identities are validated - the key is the hash of the
+public portion of a SECP256k1 pair. This has the side effect of preventing nodes from choosing any
+arbitrary identity key. Since these keys are computationally cheap to generate, we have demonstrated that
+eclipse attacks are still trivial.
+

+This audit makes no statements or warranties and is for discussion purposes only.
+In our proof of concept attack (which is shown in the a​ ccompanying repository​), we took an arbitrary valid
+target key and attempted to fill that target’s K-buckets (16 peers each) with valid identity keys derived in a
+manner consistent with the specification. The code for this attack was intentionally left poorly optimized
+such that it:
+
+     ● Runs on a single CPU core, generating a single identity at a time
+     ● Cracks buckets sequentially, starting at the furthest
+     ● Discards keys found that do not belong in the bucket that is currently being cracked
+
+This poor optimization is intended to demonstrate a sort of “best case scenario” - the attacker not having
+access to capable hardware. Our results showed that over the course of a 7 hour test, we were able to fill
+the target’s furthest 24 buckets completely (384 nodes). Perhaps more importantly, the first 19 of these
+buckets were cracked within the first half hour or the test.
+
+As the plot above shows, the time to crack each bucket takes roughly twice the time to crack the previous
+bucket, which is consistent with how we understand Kademlia’s routing table. Since there are always
+more nodes that are distant than close, eclipsing even the first 18 buckets (as is shown to be completed
+within minutes) is more than sufficient to cause significant disruption to a given target(s). Given the very
+

+low barrier to this attack, we believe that it could be carried out trivially using free cloud infrastructure
+such as Amazon t2.micro and that attackers with access to even modest hardware could cause critical
+disruption in the network.
+
+Mitigation
+
+The specification acknowledges that a proof scheme is a well-accepted mitigation strategy for eclipse
+attacks, yet dismisses the use of one citing that mobile devices would not be able to participate in the
+network. This may be true for CPU intensive proof-of-work schemes, but is not necessarily the case for
+RAM intensive schemes.
+
+Requiring that identity keys are derived from an asymmetric proof like Equihash could prove to be a
+strong mitigation strategy for these types of attacks. Memory hard proofs make for an excellent trade off.
+Even lower end semi-modern mobile devices often have at least 3GB of RAM and can generate a network
+identity without much burden or time. However, this baseline memory requirement excludes an entire
+class of virtual private server offerings, such as free Amazon t2.micro instances. We ran our same attack,
+this time doing so using our mitigation strategy for comparison.
+
+Given the same test case, but with our mitigation strategy implemented, we were only able to fill the
+furthest 5 buckets within the same 8 hour period. Even this was only achievable due to availability of
+
+Security Audit Report | Ethereum Foundation                                                             7

+~4GB RAM, making this attack much harder to parallelize than the previous test. The critical difference
+here is the difference between the initial time to crack the first bucket. On the first bucket, it took about 1
+minute per identity, because most generated keys are valid for that bucket. We feel this is a reasonable
+barrier for users upon first connecting (or rather first generating an identity key), but poses significant
+burden on would-be attackers.
+
+Of course, this strategy is not perfect and an attacker could generate the identities offline on other
+hardware for use in a similar manner, acknowledging that doing so would prove to be significantly more
+expensive. Furthering this scheme such that nodes are required to continually improve their proof over
+time is a worthwhile research endeavour.
+
+Remediation
+
+Complete remediation of this vulnerability is an area of active research and there are no known strategies
+that completely eliminate the possibility of a determined and capable attacker carrying out this type of
+attack.
+
+Status
+
+The specification acknowledges that proof schemes for identity generation are well researched, yet still
+opposes their use due to what the authors consider to be resource constraints. A ticket has been opened
+for public comment on how to proceed.
+
+Verification
+
+Unresolved: I​ n Discussion.​
+
+Issue B: Lookup Operation Does Not Include Disjoint Paths
+
+Synopsis
+
+The specification does not specify the use of disjoint lookup paths, which can make various identity and
+malicious routing attacks far more effective
+
+Impact
+
+High. If an attacker manages to control multiple nodes in a lookup path, they can manipulate the
+information delivered back to the lookup originator.
+
+Preconditions
+
+Attacker must control multiple nodes along a particular lookup path.
+
+Feasibility
+
+Trivial. This can be done very inexpensively using Amazon EC2 t3.nano instances or a similar offering
+from any virtual private server provider.
+
+Technical Details
+
+The specification outlines a solution where Kademlia table buckets are limited to two nodes from every
+/24 IP subnetwork and limits the entire table to 10 nodes per /24 IP subnetwork. This is susceptible to IP
+spoofing and anonymizing protocols where IP addresses aren’t scarce or reliably related to a single node.
+The handshake would not prevent this because according to the provided specification, the handshake
+does not verify the IP address of the requesting node or the recipient node.
+
+The specification does not provide an exact lookup algorithm for nodes. Instead, they simply define their
+lookup as an “iterative lookup”, which is consistent with Kademlia. However, particularly in the case of a
+
+Security Audit Report | Ethereum Foundation                                        8

+moderate number of adversarial nodes, the lookup algorithm benefits significantly from implementing a
+lookup that utilizes multiple disjoint paths to find nodes in the network.
+
+Mitigation
+
+Instead of limiting by IP address and subnets, we can rely on the mitigation previously outlined in Issue A
+in combination with an improved lookup algorithm that utilizes multiple disjoint lookup paths. In the
+original Kademlia specification, lookup requests iteratively query nodes, however the lookup fails if an
+adversarial node is encountered.
+
+To improve the lookup algorithm, we can implement multiple disjoint lookup paths. First, we break up the
+`k` closest nodes into `d` independent buckets, and then we kick off `d` parallel ​FIND_NODE​requests as
+usual, with one difference: we ensure we only query each node once during all of these lookups. This
+ensures that the lookup paths are truly disjoint and that encountering an adversarial node does not result
+in a failure or in the adversarial node becoming a contact and possibly becoming a bucket entry of ours.
+
+Remediation
+
+Implement multiple disjoint lookup paths.
+
+Status
+
+The specification has been updated to include details around session state storage, which resolves the
+issue where IP addresses are not verified in the handshake. In addition, the specification includes that
+multiple disjoint paths should be used during lookups.

+
+Issue C: Handshake Authentication is Broken
+
+Location
+
+https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-wire.md#handshake
+
+Synopsis
+
+The handshake protocol allows an active attacker to undermine authentication.
+
+Impact
+
+High. Allows active attackers to impersonate other nodes.
+
+Technical Details
+
+The specification states
+
+auth-response-pt = [version, id-nonce-sig, node-record]
+
+version                        =5
+
+id-nonce-sig                   = sign(static-node-key, sha256("discovery-id-nonce" ||
+
+id-nonce))
+
+...
+
+The ​id-nonce-sig​proves liveness to the receiver of the packet, but since it does not sign the
+ephemeral key of the initiator, an active attacker can simply replace the ephemeral key with one that they
+know the secret to. Then, the responder will accept, and use a key that is known to the attacker (but not
+the initiator).

+Remediation
+
+This class of protocols is very difficult to design and implement correctly. As a result, there have been
+numerous attacks on TLS 1.2 in the last ten to twenty years.
+
+We recommend learning from history by using a well-understood key exchange protocol such as DTLS,
+preferably DTLS 1.3, even in its current draft version.
+
+Mitigation
+
+Another option is to include the ephemeral key in the computation of the signature:
+
+            id-nonce-sig = sign(static-node-key,
+                                                sha256("discovery-id-nonce" || id-nonce || init-eph))
+
+This way, the responder will notice that the adversary replaced the ephemeral key and the attack is
+prevented.
+
+Status
+
+The mitigation strategy recommended has been included in the ​updated specification.​

+
+Suggestions
+
+Suggestion 1: Better Documentation of Terms and Definitions
+
+Location
+
+https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p
+
+Synopsis
+
+There were several places in the protocol where terms were simply never defined or were insufficiently
+detailed in their definition. This required us to make some assumptions around the basic workings of
+some parts of the system.
+
+For example, the Topic Registration system lacked any meaningful documentation which forced us to
+make some assumptions around its purpose and mechanics in the protocol.
+
+Mitigation
+
+More thorough documentation and definition of terms in the protocol.
+
+Status
+
+The topic index and registration system details has been expanded in the updated specification.

+Suggestion 2: Handshake Tag can be used to Confirm Protocol

+Synopsis
+
+The ​tag​part of handshake messages can be used to confirm that the node protocol is used. Consider
+three nodes A, B and C. If all three nodes communicate with each other, the xor of their tags will result in
+0:
+
+tag-A-to-B                                   = xor(sha256(B-node-id), A-node-id)
+tag-A-to-C                                   = xor(sha256(C-node-id), A-node-id)
+tag-B-to-A                                   = xor(sha256(A-node-id), B-node-id)
+tag-B-to-C                                   = xor(sha256(C-node-id), B-node-id)
+tag-C-to-A                                   = xor(sha256(A-node-id), C-node-id)
+tag-C-to-B                                   = xor(sha256(B-node-id), C-node-id)
+
+xor1 = xor(tag-B-to-A, tag-C-to-A) = xor(B-node-id, C-node-id)
+xor2 = xor(tag-A-to-B, tag-C-to-B) = xor(A-node-id, C-node-id)
+xor3 = xor(tag-A-to-C, tag-B-to-C) = xor(A-node-id, B-node-id)
+
+xor12 = xor(xor1, xor2) = xor(A-node-id, B-node-id) = xor3
+xor(xor12, xor3) = 0
+
+Since the attack is technically just out of scope, it is only added as a suggestion. Mostly, it shows that key
+exchange protocols are complex and it is very easy to miss subtle issues.
+
+Mitigation
+
+Use a well-understood key exchange protocol.
+Alternatively, this is preventable by including some randomness, such as the nonce, in the computation:
+
+          tag = xor(sha256(dst-node-id || id-nonce), src-node-id)
+
+Status
+
+The specification authors have not decided if or how to proceed with the mitigation of this issue.

+
+Suggestion 3: Make auth-tag the Output of an Approved RBG
+
+Location
+
+https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-wire.md#handshake
+
+Synopsis
+
+Since RBG mode is used, there are constraints on the number of invocations, i.e the total number of
+invocations shall not exceed 2^32, w.r.t. to any fixed initiator-key. Also, auth-tag is a critical security
+parameter as defined in FIPS Pub. 140-2 and the RGB generator must properly handle edge cases like loss
+of power, etc.
+
+Mitigation
+
+The auth-tag must be the output of an approved RBG, which must be independently initiated on any
+device.

+Recommendations
+
+We strongly recommend that an identity proof system, like the one proposed in this report, be employed in
+the next iteration of the specification.
+
+We also recommend that the Ethereum team continue to provide well-documented and easy to
+understand resources about the design and implementation of the node discovery protocol. Doing so will
+best facilitate the continued assessment of their security by both the community and future security
+auditors.
+
+Lastly, we recommend that the I​ ssues (A)​ and ​Suggestions (2 & 3)​ stated above are addressed as soon as
+possible and followed up with verification by the auditing team. In addressing the items in this report, the
+Least Authority team is available for discussion and consultation, as needed.

+
+Our Methodology
+
+We like to work with a transparent process and make our reviews a collaborative effort. The goals of our
+security audits are to improve the quality of systems we review and aim for sufficient remediation to help
+protect users. The following is the methodology we use in our security audit process.
+
+Manual Review
+
+In manually reviewing all of the documentation and code, we look for any potential issues with design and
+code logic, including error handling, protocol and header parsing, cryptographic errors, and random
+number generators. We also watch for areas where more defensive programming could reduce the risk of
+future mistakes and speed up future audits. Although our primary focus is on the in-scope documentation
+and code, we examine dependency code and behavior when it is relevant to a particular line of
+investigation.
+
+Vulnerability Analysis
+
+Our audit techniques included manual code analysis, user interface interaction, and whitebox penetration
+testing. We look at the project's web site to get a high level understanding of what functionality the
+software under review provides. We then meet with the developers to gain an appreciation of their vision
+of the software. We install and use the relevant software, exploring the user interactions and roles. While
+we do this, we brainstorm threat models and attack surfaces. We read design documentation, review
+other audit results, search for similar projects, examine source code dependencies, skim open issue
+tickets, and generally investigate details other than the implementation. We hypothesize what
+vulnerabilities may be present, creating Issue entries, and for each we follow the following Issue
+Investigation and Remediation process.

+Documenting Results
+
+We follow a conservative, transparent process for analyzing potential security vulnerabilities and seeing
+them through successful remediation. Whenever a potential issue is discovered, we immediately create
+an Issue entry for it in this document, even though we have not yet verified the feasibility and impact of
+the issue. This process is conservative because we document our suspicions early even if they are later
+shown to not represent exploitable vulnerabilities. We generally follow a process of first documenting the
+suspicion with unresolved questions, then confirming the issue through code analysis, live
+experimentation, or automated tests. Code analysis is the most tentative, and we strive to provide test
+code, log captures, or screenshots demonstrating our confirmation. After this we analyze the feasibility of
+an attack in a live system.
+
+Suggested Solutions
+
+We search for immediate mitigations that live deployments can take, and finally we suggest the
+requirements for remediation engineering for future releases. The mitigation and remediation
+recommendations should be scrutinized by the developers and deployment engineers, and successful
+mitigation and remediation is an ongoing collaborative process after we deliver our report, and before the
+details are made public.
+
+Responsible Disclosure
+
+Before our report or any details about our findings and suggested solutions are made public, we like to
+work with your team to find reasonable outcomes that can be addressed as soon as possible without an
+overly negative impact on pre-existing plans. Although the handling of issues must be done on a
+case-by-case basis, we always like to agree on a timeline for resolution that balances the impact on the
+users and the needs of your project team. We take this agreed timeline into account before publishing any
+reports to avoid the necessity for full disclosure.
