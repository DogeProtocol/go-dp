-Introduction
-
-         “Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On
-         Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed,
-         and is accessible anywhere in the world.”
-
-                                                                                                         From https://ethereum.org/
-
-         This report documents the results of a consulting exercise completed by Cure53 for the
-         Ethereum (ETH) team. The project was carried out in December 2019 and January 2020
-         and mostly focused on the Ethereum Node Discovery Protocol v5.
-
-         In terms of resources, Cure53 was awarded a pool of ten days that could be used for
-         testing. To date, five days have been used by two members of the Cure53 team involved
-         in this exercise. This means that there is a remaining budget of five days that can still be
-         allocated by Ethereum to further work.
-
-         To make sure that the exercise fits in with the goals and interests of Ethereum, the
-         consulting work was accompanied by a kick-off, several meetings and communications
-         enabled by the Discord server maintained by the Ethereum team, specifically through a
-         dedicated channel (#discv5) that was opened for the purpose of sharing exercise-related
-         details. The two members of the Cure53 joined the channel, yet it should be stated that
-         one had a managerial and administrative role, while the other performed the tasks
-         related strictly to the consulting and analysis.

-
-         In terms of approaches, the analysis centered on the Discv5 protocol, which is used to
-         establish decentralized handshakes between nodes. The protocol had already been
-         audited in the past and comes as the fifth iteration of the ETH discovery protocol
-         framework. As part of the audit, the protocol’s handshake and wire format were both
-         subject to formal evaluation. This also included exotic XOR-based constructions that the
-         ETH team noted as needing particular attention.
-
-         The findings encompass two items marked with corresponding severity levels which
-         denote impact of the findings for the connected implementation. These outcomes take
-         on a case of the protocol being rolled out ‘as is’. While one concern has only
-         Informational character, the other was evaluated as Medium because of the
-         shortcomings affecting mutual authentication for the bootstrapping nodes.
-
-         The following sections will first report on the consulting scope and information shared
-         with Cure53 prior to the beginning of the engagement and aimed at supporting analytical
-         tasks. Next, the concerns and observations pertinent to the scope and discussed with
-         the Ethereum team are documented by Cure53 in a chronological order. The report will
-         then close with a brief conclusion in which the results of this consulting exercise are
-         summarized alongside high-level advice for possible hardening and reinforcement of the

-Miscellaneous Issues
-
-         This section covers those noteworthy findings that did not lead to an exploit but might aid
-         an attacker in achieving their malicious goals in the future. Most of these results are
-         vulnerable code snippets that did not provide an easy way to be called. Conclusively,
-         while a vulnerability is present, an exploit might not always be possible.
-
-ETH-06-001 Protocol: Limitations in noderecord directory authentication (Medium)
-         It was found that the bootstrapping procedure that the Discv5 nodes rely on fails to
-         provide any mutual authentication with regards to the bootstrapping nodes. If the initial
-         bootstrap nodes are compromised, all future decentralized network interaction by the
-         victim’s nodes would be controlled by the attacker.
-
-         The Discv5 designers are aware of this risk and propose using Node Discovery Via DNS
-         (EIP-1459)1 as a potential remedy for the issue. In the case of EIP-1459 deployment,
-         root-signing key communication becomes critical. Therefore, it is best to ship it hard-
-         coded within Discv5 clients, with rigid rekeying protocol requirements.
-
-ETH-06-002 Protocol: Pre-shared key support considerations (Info)
-         The decentralized use-case for Discv5 cannot be realistically paired with mutual
-         authentication based on long-term keys. However, it is recommended to investigate
-         supporting pre-shared key (PSK) features, which could allow nodes to optionally
-         instantiate authenticated connections. This calls for both providing a matching pre-
-         shared symmetric key. Such features are available in TLS 1.3, where they are used for
-         session resumption2 and in the Noise Protocol Framework, which employs them to
-         improve the authentication security properties of sessions3.
-
-         Further comparisons have been drawn between Discv5 and certain Noise Handshake
-         Patterns, such as NK4 or IK5. According to the Discv5 designers, the main reason for
-         reticence regarding the use of the Noise Protocol framework stemmed from uncertainty
-         as to whether session IDs can be included within the wire protocol. Despite this, session
-         IDs and other Discv5-relevant materials can be included within a custom data
-         serialization format within the Noise Handshake Protocol payloads.

-Conclusions
-
-         This brief consultancy exercise, which focused on analyzing the Ethereum Node
-         Discovery Protocol v5, concludes on a positive note. After spending five days on the
-         scope in late 2019 and early 2020, two members of the Cure53 team can confirm that
-         this item of the Ethereum scope makes a strong impression.
-
-         To give some details, it can be reiterated that the protocol’s handshake and wire format
-         were both formally examined and the evaluation extended to exotic XOR-based
-         constructions as well. The latter were specifically named as focal points for this
-         assessment by the Ethereum team. Cure53 made only minor observations about
-         possible improvements and shortcomings that the team responsible for the security of
-         the Discv5 protocol could consider.
-
-         A call was scheduled with the client to discuss the outcomes as regards handshake
-         authentication, PSK support, bootstrap nodes, key compromise impersonation attacks,
-         XOR constructions, as well as Discv5’s custom wire format. The report follows up on the
-         matters tackled on the call and elaborate on the issues through proper documentation.
-         First, authentication-related findings can be found in ETH-06-001, which additionally
-         offers some comments on mitigations strategies that the ETH team has already been
-         planning. Secondly, ETH-06-002 suggests adding pre-shared key support to the Discv5
-         protocol as an optional measure to reinforce authentication.
-
-         At this stage, Cure53 has no further concerns to report. In light of the observations made
-         during this late 2019-early 2020 consultancy exercise, Cure53 is happy to report that the
-         Ethereum Node Discovery Protocol v5 may be seen as sound and robust.
-
-         Cure53 would like to thank Martin Holst Swende and Felix Lange from the Ethereum
-         team for their excellent project coordination, support and assistance, both before and
-         during this assignment.

+         reticence regarding the use of the Noise Protocol framework stemmed from uncertainty
+         as to whether session IDs can be included within the wire protocol. Despite this, session
+         IDs and other Discv5-relevant materials can be included within a custom data
+         serialization format within the Noise Handshake Protocol payloads.

+Conclusions
+
+         This brief consultancy exercise, which focused on analyzing the Ethereum Node
+         Discovery Protocol v5, concludes on a positive note. After spending five days on the
+         scope in late 2019 and early 2020, two members of the Cure53 team can confirm that
+         this item of the Ethereum scope makes a strong impression.
+
+         To give some details, it can be reiterated that the protocol’s handshake and wire format
+         were both formally examined and the evaluation extended to exotic XOR-based
+         constructions as well. The latter were specifically named as focal points for this
+         assessment by the Ethereum team. Cure53 made only minor observations about
+         possible improvements and shortcomings that the team responsible for the security of
+         the Discv5 protocol could consider.
+
+         A call was scheduled with the client to discuss the outcomes as regards handshake
+         authentication, PSK support, bootstrap nodes, key compromise impersonation attacks,
+         XOR constructions, as well as Discv5’s custom wire format. The report follows up on the
+         matters tackled on the call and elaborate on the issues through proper documentation.
+         First, authentication-related findings can be found in ETH-06-001, which additionally
+         offers some comments on mitigations strategies that the ETH team has already been
+         planning. Secondly, ETH-06-002 suggests adding pre-shared key support to the Discv5
+         protocol as an optional measure to reinforce authentication.
+
+         At this stage, Cure53 has no further concerns to report. In light of the observations made
+         during this late 2019-early 2020 consultancy exercise, Cure53 is happy to report that the
+         Ethereum Node Discovery Protocol v5 may be seen as sound and robust.
+
+         Cure53 would like to thank Martin Holst Swende and Felix Lange from the Ethereum
+         team for their excellent project coordination, support and assistance, both before and
+         during this assignment.
